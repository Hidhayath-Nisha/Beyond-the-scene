📌 Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) to the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to identify distinct "Business Archetypes" in the film industry. By analyzing financial metrics (Budget, Revenue, ROI) alongside Genre data, we move beyond simple genre classifications to understand the economic structure of movie production.

🎯 Key Objectives

Identify Patterns: Group movies based on their risk/reward profiles.
Analyze Efficiency: Use Return on Investment (ROI) to compare low-budget hits with high-budget blockbusters fairly.
Strategic Insight: Provide data-driven recommendations for greenlighting movie projects.

📊 Key Findings

The analysis identified 4 primary archetypes:

Hidden Gems (Cluster 0): Low Budget, Highest ROI (Efficiency Kings).
Family Cash Cows (Cluster 1): High Budget, Highest Revenue (Market Dominators).
Action Blockbusters (Cluster 2): Highest Budget, Moderate ROI (High Risk/High Reward).
Mid-Budget Flops (Cluster 3): Moderate Budget, Lowest ROI (The "Death Zone").

🌟 Enhancement: Genre-Stratified Clustering
Following academic feedback, we implemented a secondary analysis that clusters movies within their specific genres. This revealed that "Big Budget" is relative:

Action Blockbuster: $150M+
Horror Blockbuster: $40M+ This proves that financial success must be judged relative to genre expectations.
